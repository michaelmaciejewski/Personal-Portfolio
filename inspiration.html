	<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	<a href="https://kotki.co/?ref=land-book.com">A website I really like</a>
	<p>I really like the layout of this website as it is very unique but fits the theme of what the person can do. The simplicity of the buttons make it not to confusing but this also displays visual design very well. It also has a very good zoom feature that changes the pages as you scroll making it very interaction</p>
