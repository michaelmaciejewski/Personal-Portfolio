	</div>
	<div>
	<p>My introduction to the complexities of algorithms along with the consistent progression of technology has generated my passion for data analysis. I enjoy the collaboration of ideas and am open-minded to the input of others. The opportunities that originate from analytical programming have motivated me to work to find solutions to inefficiencies. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Through my educational experience at the University of Colorado, Boulder I have gained a basic knowledge of C++ and Python. Prior to this, I was introduced to Swift and Xcode in High School and have been exercising its intricacies since. In 2018, I was awarded a National Jesuit Award for digital art, which has motivated me to pursue a Creative Technology and Design minor in college. I have furthermore participated in the development of a mobile application that I built specifically for children coming from low-income families.
	<br>
	<br>
	The impact and power of technology was shown to me through the app development which affirmed my passion for the creative design process. Most specifically, the process of empathizing with students and using code to create something impactful motivated my passion for problem-solving and creativity. This not only strengthened my comfortability with programming but also assisted me in the development of my interpersonal skills. My self-driven mentality allows me to adapt quickly and learn effectively.
